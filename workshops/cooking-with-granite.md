# Cooking with Granite - hands-on experience using a family of open, performant, and trusted AI models

The Granite family of foundation models spans an increasing variety of modalities, including language, code, time series, and science (e.g., materials) - with much more to come. This walk-through of the Granite Community's Cookbooks for the IBM Granite models will give you hands-on experience using the Granite models (including those specialized for code and time-series) in short recipes. The session will start with simple use cases that demonstrate zero-shot inference with the code and time-series models.  The recipes will grow more complex to cover data preparation, RAG, tool use, and agentic workflows.  

Pre-requisites: these workshops can be run in a browser (just need a GitHub and Google account) or the more adventurous can run them locally with Python 3.12 and Jupyter Notebook installed.
