An API-first approach to take over the world
---

Using LB + MicroGateway?:
In this dev lab, we will go from zero to world domination in just a few easy steps®. We'll start by building out an API layer with the open source tool, LoopBack. That will be magical in how fast and easy we can build our own APIs. Since it is built on top of Express, we can add some BFF functionality. Then we’ll orchestrate some microservices, serverless functions, 3rd party APIs and legacy systems. From this position we can assume total control of the universe. It’ll be awesome.

Using LB + APIC:
In this workshop, we will go from zero to world domination in just a few easy steps®. We will start by building out an API layer with the open source tool, LoopBack. That will be magical in how fast and easy we can build our own APIs. Then we’ll transition to IBM’s API Connect to orchestrate microservices, serverless functions, 3rd party APIs and legacy systems. From this position we can assume total control of the universe. It’ll be awesome.
