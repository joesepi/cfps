# What's New and What's Next? The current and future state of JS

Let's talk about the awesome new features that have recently landed in ECMAScript, the official name of the JavaScript language. We'll explore the benefits of these new features through examples, but we'll also take a look behind the scenes and see how features like these are proposed, discussed and integrated into the ever evolving language. We'll spend a little time learning about the standards organization, Ecma, as well as an Ecma technical committee, TC39, which oversees the development of ECMAScript. We'll also peek at some proposed features that are currently in process to see what the future of JavaScript will include. It'll be fun!
