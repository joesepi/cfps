My journey as a JS engineer, front to back
---

As a self-taught JavaScript engineer who began his adventures in the web world from the design/front-end angle, I've always been a little intimidated by the backend, especially compiled languages like Java. I’ve been guilty of “throwing it over the fence” when it comes to the separation of front/back. However, with the awesomeness of Node.js, that fence has become much easier to see over. And now that I am familiar with the open source tool, LoopBack, I feel like I’m a Node.js API pro ... AND YOU CAN TOO! I literally want to API ALL THE THINGS!

I'd like to share with you my journey: my odd and late entry into programming, struggling with imposter syndrome, overcoming the barrier between client/server and finding confidence to reside in that "full stack JavaScript" world. In addition to "my story," I'd also like to quickly show you how awesome loopback is. Feel free to code along. Pre-reqs: Node.js, LoopBack-CLI.
