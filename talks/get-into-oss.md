Get into Open Source! How to start or do more in the OSS community
---
In this talk, we will go over the many ways in which you---YES YOU!---can get involved with open source. Whether you are highly technical or not technical at all, there are many ways to contribute to the open source community through: code contributions, issue triage, project management, communications, community relations, design, writing, testing, documentation, integrations, and more!. The more people involved the better, so let's destroy all barriers to entry, establish some on-ramps and hit the road!

This talk is not just cheerleading. We will go over real examples and real entry points for becoming a valuable contributor to the open source community.
