# Zero to Swagger in Moments

In just a few short minutes, we'll build an API-driven Node application. With the open source tool, LoopBack, we can derive interconnected models---with full CRUD functionality---based on some questions about the shape and details of our data. But that's just the beginning. We'll also take our APIs further with cloud/local data-stores, relationships between models, and access control lists (ACLs.) Within a short time, we'll have a fully functioning platform with a number of APIs accessing robust models, handled securely using member role privileges that include full-featured account management (login/out, forgot password, etc).


# Getting started with Node.js APIs using LoopBack

Go from zero to Swagger in just a few minutes. We'll spend the rest of the time high-fiving each other. I'm kidding. We'll also take our APIs further with data-stores, relationships, and access control lists (ACLs.) Within a short time, we'll have a fully functioning platform with a number of interconnected models, served securely based on privileges derived from full-featured member roles within a Node.js web application.
