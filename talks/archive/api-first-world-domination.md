An API-first approach to take over the world
---

Let's take a look at how APIs could transform our world and then dive into how you can start on that journey today with the amazing and magical, open-source tool LoopBack. We will literally get an API up and running in 73 seconds†. We'll then slow down a little and look at what you can do with that API and some of the other cool things IBM has to offer in this space. Whether you are a developer building the next Twilio or a product manager at the next cat app, you will walk away from this talk reinvigorated to take on this world. And you will be equipped with the tools to take it over.

Using LB + MicroGateway?:
In this dev lab, we will go from zero to world domination in just a few easy steps®. We'll start by building out an API layer with the open source tool, LoopBack. That will be magical in how fast and easy we can build our own APIs. Since it is built on top of Express, we can add some BFF functionality. Then we’ll orchestrate some microservices, serverless functions, 3rd party APIs and legacy systems. From this position we can assume total control of the universe. It’ll be awesome.

Using LB + APIC:
In this workshop, we will go from zero to world domination in just a few easy steps®. We will start by building out an API layer with the open source tool, LoopBack. That will be magical in how fast and easy we can build our own APIs. Then we’ll transition to IBM’s API Connect to orchestrate microservices, serverless functions, 3rd party APIs and legacy systems. From this position we can assume total control of the universe. It’ll be awesome.
