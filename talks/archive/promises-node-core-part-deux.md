# Promises API in Node.js core: part deux, the update!

Currently (Jun 1, 2019) there are only a handful of 'promisified' Node.js core APIs. But the great news is that there has been momentum building in tackling this effort and by the time of NodeConf EU, I expect that we will have made a lot of progress. I'd like to share with you all an update on: Where we are? What else needs to be done? And if more is needed, how can you help?
