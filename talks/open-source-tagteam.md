# Open Source: how-to, lessons learned and more

We'll walk through how to get involved in open source: tips/tricks, conventions, tools and process. We'll spend some time sharing lessons learned to give you some guidance on your journey. We'll also talk about the Node.js community: how the Foundation is structured and how you can get involved, as well as how to contribute to the larger Node.js open source ecosystem itself. We hope for this to be an encouraging, enlightening and enabling session to get you started or to further you along in your open source adventures.
