# Building Serverless Applications on the Apache OpenWhisk Platform

Apache OpenWhisk provides a powerful and flexible environment for deploying cloud-native applications driven by data, message, and API call events. Learn why serverless architectures are attractive for many emerging cloud workloads and when you should consider OpenWhisk for your next project. We will also explore three sample applications covering how the OpenWhisk programming model enables you to implement REST APIs and process non-HTTP events at scale.
