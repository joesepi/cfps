# Quantum Computing and JavaScript??? - Hell yeah!!!

Spooky action at a distance. Particle entanglement. Superposition. Wave–particle duality. Schrödinger's cat is both dead AND alive. This stuff is nuts!

Let's talk quantum: Why quantum? How does it work? What can we do now with quantum? What should we be planning to do in the future with quantum? And of course, we'll do some live coding on a real quantum machine!
