What tools and approaches make the open source Node.js API framework LoopBack so awesome? Let's dig in and see how the pieces fit together and what those pieces are.
In this talk, after I show you how you can have an API layer in 5 minutes, we'll then examine:
- how a battle-tested web framework like Express can be a powerful foundation for LoopBack;
- how a scaffolding framework like Yeoman makes LoopBack easy to use; and
- what other tooling and approaches are used to bring LoopBack to life
