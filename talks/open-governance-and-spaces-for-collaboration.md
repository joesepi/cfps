# Open Governance and making great places for Collaboration (Michael and Joe?)

As the OpenJS foundation ramps up and new opportunities for collaboration come to play for JavaScript projects across the board it's a great time to come hear from some of those who have been involved along the way. From the formation of the Node.js Foundation, the JS Foundation and now the OpenJS foundation a lot of work has gone into building great places where both individuals and companies can come together to make impactful technical, organizational, and community contributions. Come learn about some of the core concepts and principles behind open communities and governance and how these steer our ongoing work in the OpenJS foundation.
