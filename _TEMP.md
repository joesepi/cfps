How to deploy, debug and optimize Node.js apps in production
A practical walk through of production-ready techniques, tips and tricks; as well as the lessons learned getting there. This talk pulls knowledge from my experience at IBM, Adobe and the New York Times as well as insight and experience from other experts in the field.

Promises API in Node.js core: where we are and where we’ll get to
Currently only 'fs' and 'dns' have an experimental promise api in Node core. People LOL at node.js core modules for still using the callback pattern. I could launch into a bunch of puns here but instead I’ll just say the current status is sad but fixable. Where are we? What do we need to do? How can you help?

Testing Node Core; there be dragons
What does it look like to test Node.js core in a wide variety of scenarios (versions, platforms, hardware)? What state are we in? What’s working, what’s not? How can we improve? How can you get involved?

Node.js Community
The story of the Node.js Foundation Community Committee, how the Foundation supports the community and a brief look at the overall community at large.

Get into Open Source! How to start or do more in the OSS community
In this talk, we will go over the many ways in which you---YES YOU!---can get involved with open source. Whether you are highly technical or not technical at all, there are many ways to contribute to the open source community through: code contributions, issue triage, project management, communications, community relations, design, writing, testing, documentation, integrations, and more!. The more people involved the better, so let's destroy all barriers to entry, establish some on-ramps and hit the road!

This talk is not just cheerleading. We will go over real examples and real entry points for becoming a valuable contributor to the open source community.

Open Source: how-to, lessons learned and more
We'll walk through how to get involved in open source: tips/tricks, conventions, tools and process. We'll spend some time sharing lessons learned to give you some guidance on your journey. We'll also talk about the Node.js community: how the Foundation is structured and how you can get involved, as well as how to contribute to the larger Node.js open source ecosystem itself. We hope for this to be an encouraging, enlightening and enabling session to get you started or to further you along in your open source adventures. (Co-presented: Tierney Cyren & Joe Sepi)
