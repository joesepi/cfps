# Promises API in Node.js core: part "do", the update!

Currently (Jun 1, 2019) there are only a handful of 'promisified' Node.js core APIs. But the great news is that there has been momentum building in tackling this effort and by the time of NodeConf EU, I expect that we will have made a lot of progress. I'd like to share with you all an update on: Where we are? What else needs to be done? And if more is needed, how can you help?

_Note: I gave part one of this talk at JSConf EU. There has been a lot of momentum building on this work. I submitted this talk to NodeConf EU as well. If the NodeConfEU submission is accepted, then this will transform into part III, the revenge of async or something like that. This work is ongoing for the forseeable future. And I had a conversation today that got me excited about what's to come, which could push this effort beyond Node and into the JavaScript spec._

# First 200 Days: the Adventures of the OpenJS Cross Project Council

An update from the OpenJS Foundation Cross Project Council featuring: tales from the humble beginnings; the challenges of early days; that time where Joe made that dumb mistake; our successes, small and large; and the clear bright future emerging from the dust and sweat.

_Note: I believe this would work best as a talk co-presented by Jory Burson and myself, Joe Sepi. However, it could also be parlayed into a nice little panel with some additional awesome folks on stage (TBD)._
